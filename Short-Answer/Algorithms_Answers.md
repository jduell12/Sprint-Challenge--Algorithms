#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime for this algorithm is O(n). Since the while loop goes until a is greater or equal to n^3 and inside the while loop a is added to n^2. Cubing something means you multiply the number by iteself 3 times. When added n^2 to itself it'll take n times for a to be equal or greater to n^3.

b)

c)
